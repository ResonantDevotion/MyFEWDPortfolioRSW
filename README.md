# MyFEWDPortfolioRSW
A portfolio showcasing my html and css skills.

## Description
This portfolio was created to showcase my learnings and skills that I built up from my FEWD course. This is so that I can show potential employers a tangible demonstration of my skills. It is also a work in progress that I will add to as I develop my skills, so I will also have a version control platform of my progress.
At this current point 18/03/23, I have added HTML, CSS, flex and grid boxes and am working on webpage responsiveness. It is the first time I have built a website from scratch and have also been experimenting with color combinations and aesthetic.


## Acceptance Criteria
Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs (min. submission requirements):

- When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
- When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
- When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
- When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
- When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport
