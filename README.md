# MyFEWDPortfolioRSW
A portfolio showcasing all of what I have learnt in Front End Web Development.

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

## Acceptance Criteria
Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport


## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
